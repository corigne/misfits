# Nathan Jodoin - Resume Site

### UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Currently this is just a slightly modified Sveltkit template.
I have been working on other personal projects in the meantime, including maintaining a fork of
[polybar-spotify-module](https://github.com/corigne/polybar-spotify-module)
and a project which I did in part because of class:
[pngwin](https://github.com/corigne/pngwin)

I will be turning the resume site into a feature rich blog, and interactive resume, probably this summer.
I'm also working on a new polybar module in rust for handling music players via dbus.
